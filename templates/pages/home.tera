    hello!! welcome to my website :3
  </p>
  <p>
    i'm an indie software developer from Poland doing some cool stuffs on the internet :&gt;
    <br>
    just look around this very website and see how cool it is :D
    <br>
    you know what's even cooler though?
    <br>
    that its source code is available publically in a <a class="target-blank" href="https://github.com/adamperkowski/website">github repo</a>
    <span class="inline-img"><img src="/img/gifs/smilies/shocked.gif" alt="shocked smiley"></span>
  </p>
  <p>
    anyway, i love listening to music. mostly (post)grunge and a lot of different rock/metal flavors
    <span class="inline-img"><img src="/img/gifs/smilies/rock-on.gif" alt="rock on smiley"></span>
    <br>
    i play video games from time to time. my favs are OneShot, Dead Cells, The Witcher 3 and Elden Ring!
    <br>
    i also play some guitar and draw, pretty bad at both though :c
